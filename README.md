# ðŸ“° Headline Generator

This repository contains a Streamlit app for generating headlines from text using a MarianMT model hosted on the Hugging Face Transformers hub. The model, `willhsp/headline-generator-opus-mt-en-mul`, has been fine-tuned from the `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-mul` model on the `valurank/News_headlines` dataset (both available on Hugging Face) for headline generation tasks. Users can input text directly or upload a text file containing articles, and the app will generate corresponding headlines.
